546f0cb07 Merge branch 'master' into pr-erase-config
9c4e44bc8 Added print messages to show progress. And code to ensure the UART speed stayed at 74880 for a more complete viewing of messages. Well at least, it stays at 74880 for a longer time than it was. Added pinMode filter to prevent UART TX pin from being disabled during user_init().

99c6e4ca4 Merge branch 'pr-hwdt-stack-dump' of github.com:mhightower83/Arduino into pr-hwdt-stack-dump
1df82c06f Added delays around uart_div_modify. This appeara to resolve the lost data problem that occurs when printing after a flash upload using esptool. Curiously, esptool stub also uses similar delays. Word choices and description improvements.
309ac45b8 Merge branch 'master' into pr-hwdt-stack-dump
c2cbb87df Removed clutter of having an alternate printing method. Regular global strings have worked reliably. Tweaked reset reason detection. Reordered elements in global structure. Improve #if test for debug option Always improving comments.
b8abe5bab Moved all configuration options to the top. Adjusted configuration option order for most likely to be used to the top. Tried to improve comments. Replace numbers with enum values.
25f0140b4 Style plus Fix issue with HWDT reason detection when sketch crashes too fast. Added sample sketch menu option for crashing with a function defined with a weak attribute via prototype, but never actually defined in full function form. eg. `void trouble(void){return;}`
7978860da Merge branch 'master' into pr-hwdt-stack-dump
093ac0242 Improvements to reset reason determination. Improved comments. Added option to match the UART speed used by the sketch. Added option to print greeting at the start to indicate the HWDT stack dump code is active. Isolated logic for handling strings: one assuming they are not inited at the time the code is running and one that does. The later appears to be the case.
