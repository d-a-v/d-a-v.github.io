99c6e4ca Merge branch 'pr-hwdt-stack-dump' of github.com:mhightower83/Arduino into pr-hwdt-stack-dump
1df82c06 Added delays around uart_div_modify. This appeara to resolve the lost data problem that occurs when printing after a flash upload using esptool. Curiously, esptool stub also uses similar delays. Word choices and description improvements.

c2cbb87d Removed clutter of having an alternate printing method. Regular global strings have worked reliably. Tweaked reset reason detection. Reordered elements in global structure. Improve #if test for debug option Always improving comments.
b8abe5ba Moved all configuration options to the top. Adjusted configuration option order for most likely to be used to the top. Tried to improve comments. Replace numbers with enum values.
25f0140b Style plus Fix issue with HWDT reason detection when sketch crashes too fast. Added sample sketch menu option for crashing with a function defined with a weak attribute via prototype, but never actually defined in full function form. eg. `void trouble(void){return;}`
7978860d Merge branch 'master' into pr-hwdt-stack-dump
093ac024 Improvements to reset reason determination. Improved comments. Added option to match the UART speed used by the sketch. Added option to print greeting at the start to indicate the HWDT stack dump code is active. Isolated logic for handling strings: one assuming they are not inited at the time the code is running and one that does. The later appears to be the case.
